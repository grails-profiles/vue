description: A profile for creating Grails applications with a Vue.js frontend
instructions: |
    This profile provides a client/server multi-project build structure. The server Grails app is using the rest-api profile with CORS enabled. It can be started using 'grails run-app' or using the Gradle wrapper:

      ./gradlew server:bootRun

    The Vue client app has been built using the vue-cli. It can be started via 'npm start' (in which case you will need to run 'npm install' to install npm dependencies) or using the Gradle wrapper (which will install npm dependencies automatically if needed):

      ./gradlew client:start

    For support, please use the Groovy Community Slack (https://groovycommunity.slack.com/) or open an issue on Github: https://github.com/grails-profiles/react/issues
