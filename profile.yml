description: A profile for creating Grails applications with a Vue.js frontend
instructions: |
    This profile provides a client/server multi-project build structure. The server Grails app is using the rest-api profile with CORS enabled. It can be started using 'grails run-app' or using the Gradle wrapper:

      ./gradlew server:bootRun

    The Vue client app has been built via the Vue CLI (https://cli.vuejs.org/). It can be started via npm/yarn (`npm run serve`/`yarn serve`), or by using the Gradle wrapper (which will install npm dependencies automatically if needed):

      ./gradlew client:serve

    For support, please use the Grails Community Slack (https://grails-slack.cfapps.io) or open an issue on Github: https://github.com/grails-profiles/vue/issues
