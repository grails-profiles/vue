This profile provides support for building Grails applications with a Vue.js frontend. It includes a simple Vue app which renders the default Grails index page, and retrieves application metadata via a REST call to the Grails application. A simple unit test and an end-to-end (integration) test is included within the Vue project. The Vue project follows the conventions used in the Vue-CLI `webpack` template.

To create an application using the `vue` profile you can use the following command:

[source, bash]
----
grails create-app myapp --profile=vue
----

You can also choose this profile when generating your project from the
http://start.grails.org/[Grails Application Forge], either from the web app or via the API:

[source, bash]
----
curl -O start.grails.org/myapp.zip -d profile=vue
----

Grails Application Forge is a great way to discover the different provided features in the profile.
