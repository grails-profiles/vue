This profile provides a client/server multi-project build structure. The server Grails app is using the rest-api profile with CORS enabled. It can be started using 'grails run-app' or using the Gradle wrapper:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew server:bootRun

The Vue client app has been built via the vue-cli, using the webpack template. It can be started via 'npm start' (in which case you will need to run 'npm install' to install npm dependencies) or using the Gradle wrapper (which will install npm dependencies automatically if needed):

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew client:start
----
